## 🚀 The Product
**B2B Outreach Pro** is a self-hosted, cloud-native automated outreach platform designed for agencies and high-growth B2B teams. Unlike generic tools, it features a **Self-Learning AI Brain (RAG)** that adapts to each user's specific offer, tone, and case studies.

-   **Automated Enrichment**: Built-in "Discovery Engine" ethically finds public business contact data, saving users money on expensive lead lists.
-   **Inbox Protection**: "Smart Rotation" load-balances sending across multiple accounts to ensure high deliverability.
